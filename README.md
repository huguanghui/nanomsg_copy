Welcome to nanomsg
==================

The nanomsg library is a simple high-performance implementation of several 
"scalability protocols". These scalability protocols are light-weight messaging
protocols which can be used to solve a number of very common messaging
patterns, such as request/reply, publish/subscribe, survey/respondent,
and so forth. These protocols can run over a variety of transports such 
as TCP, UNIX sockets, and even WebSocket.
